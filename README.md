GreenTrip Prototype
Welcome to the GreenTrip Prototype repository for the MAKE IT CHALLENGE HACKATHON 2024.

Overview
This project represents our team's prototype for GreenTrip, developed as part of the MAKE IT CHALLENGE HACKATHON 2024. The current implementation features a semi-static User Interface (UI) built with HTML and CSS, with dynamic data integration powered by Jupiter AI.

Project Structure
The project includes the following key files:

index.html: The main HTML file providing the structure of the homepage.
styles.css: The CSS file for styling the UI.
Additional HTML and CSS files for other pages and components.
Features
Semi-Static UI: The UI is created using HTML and CSS, providing a clear and user-friendly interface.
Dynamic Data Integration: We have integrated dynamic data using the Jupiter AI API, allowing for real-time token price display and other features.
Current Status
This prototype is still a work in progress. While the UI is semi-static, we plan to make user data fully dynamic with the help of JavaScript. This enhancement is crucial for completing our vision for GreenTrip.

Future Work
Dynamic User Data: Integrate JavaScript to make user data dynamic.
Additional Features: Continue to add and improve features for a better user experience.
**We gave also decided to take out the exchange and deals page and instead we will allow user to straight away trade tokens from our UI.
