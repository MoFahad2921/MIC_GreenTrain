# GreenTrip Prototype

Welcome to the GreenTrip Prototype repository for the MAKE IT CHALLENGE HACKATHON 2024.

## Overview

This project represents our team's prototype for GreenTrip, developed as part of the MAKE IT CHALLENGE HACKATHON 2024. The current implementation features a semi-static User Interface (UI) built with HTML and CSS, with dynamic data integration powered by Jupiter AI.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following key files:

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file providing the structure of the homepage.
- **Additional HTML and CSS files**: For other pages and components.
- **JavaScript**: Work in progress.

## Features

- **Semi-Static UI**: The UI is created using HTML and CSS, providing a clear and user-friendly interface.
- **Dynamic Data Integration**: We have integrated dynamic data using the Jupiter AI API, allowing for real-time token price display and other features.

## Current Status

This prototype is still a work in progress. While the UI is semi-static, I plan to make user data fully dynamic with the help of JavaScript. This enhancement is crucial for completing GreenTrip.

## Future Work

- **Dynamic User Data**: Integrate JavaScript to make user data dynamic.
- **Additional Features**: Continue to add and improve features for a better user experience.
- **Change in Features**: We have also decided to remove the Exchange and Deals page for vouchers and coupons and instead allow users to trade tokens directly from our UI.
